# Tang Pai Nai — Roadmap

Single source of truth for **what is built, what is next, and which decisions are already locked**.
Read this first, before `AGENTS.md`, when picking up work or planning a feature.

## Product

**Tang Pai Nai (ตังค์ไปไหน, "where did the money go?")** is a personal income / expense tracker. Its
reference app is **Money Lover**, which the owner uses today; we keep what works there and drop the
rest. It's built for the owner and their family: anyone may sign up, and family members are brought
in by invitation to a shared wallet. No SEO, no monetisation. It feels like a native mobile app
(installable PWA with a bottom tab bar).

## Repo layout

One git repo, two independent apps side by side. There's no monorepo tool: each folder has its own
`package.json`, `node_modules` and lint config, and is deployed as its own Vercel project (Root
Directory = `api` / `web`).

| Path             | What                                   | Stack                                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `api/`           | REST API                               | Express 5 + TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, SQLite (Turso in prod) |
| `web/`           | Mobile-first PWA                       | Angular 22 (zoneless, signals), Tailwind v4, spartan/ui     |
| `docs/features/` | Feature specs, shared by both apps     | Markdown                                                    |
| `ROADMAP.md`     | This file                              |                                                             |
| `.github/`       | CI per app (path-filtered), automation | GitHub Actions                                              |

There's no shared code package. The API contract is the API's OpenAPI spec plus `docs/features/`,
and the web app mirrors the types it needs in `<feature>.type.ts`. Because both apps live in one
repo, one PR can change spec, API and web together.

## How we build a feature

**Vertical slices, one feature at a time.** Finish a feature end-to-end before starting the next.

**One feature (or one part of it, e.g. Auth 4.3) = one new Claude session = one branch = one PR.**
Start a fresh session for each instead of continuing an old one. The new session knows nothing of
earlier chats: it learns only from the repo (this file, the feature's spec, the `AGENTS.md` files
and `DESIGN.md`). So a session ends by writing down everything the next one needs (step 4), and a
decision agreed in chat but not in the repo is lost.

0. **Feature doc**. Write or refine `docs/features/<feature>.md` (template in that folder's
   `README.md`), agree on it, and commit it on its own (`docs(<feature>): ...`). It is the shared spec
   for API and web.
1. **API**. Drizzle schema + migration + seed, then the feature (entity → repository port → service →
   Drizzle adapter → schema/controller/routes), following `AGENTS.md` §6 and §8.
2. **Web**. Screens under `src/app/features/<feature>/`, following the web repo's `AGENTS.md`.
3. **Tests**. Once the feature works end to end (manual checks: `curl` for the API, Playwright for
   the web) and the owner confirms the behavior, write the tests for both apps as the last commits
   of the PR (see `api/AGENTS.md` §1 Testing). Not earlier: tests against code that is still
   changing just get rewritten.
4. **Update this file** (the hand-off to the next session). Move the feature to ✅ and note any new
   decision, deferred item or known issue, including tests left pending for a feature that is
   still experimental. Rules that apply beyond the feature go where they belong (`AGENTS.md`,
   `DESIGN.md`), not only in the PR or the chat.

Small, separate commits per step. Each PR gets a Vercel preview URL, so check it on a phone before
merging.

Each row gets its `docs/features/<feature>.md` before work starts. Rows 0–8 (with 4a) are the MVP.
After #8 the app can replace Money Lover for daily use. Until #17, everything runs **locally only** (see locked
decision "Local-first").

---

## Next: Debt / loan (#13)

Not started: write `docs/features/debt.md` first, with a mock-up (owner's way since #10). The
order stays **#13 → #14 → #15 → #16**, then #17 when the owner asks. The owner's direction is in
the Backlog ("Debt / loan (#13)"): borrowed money isn't income, and **money is counted as an
expense once**, when spent or when repaid (probably a choice per debt). Points to put to the
owner with a proposal (none decided): a debt as its own table or as a kind of wallet; lent vs
borrowed; repayments as transfers, transactions or their own rows; interest; how a debt shows
in the Wallets tab, the totals and the reports; instalments as a recurring rule (#12 can record
them).

Known, for later:

- The initial bundle is 716.8 kB after #12 (warning at 750 kB); keep new screens lazy and their
  services out of the shell (#12 loads `RecurringService` with a dynamic `import()` after the
  shell's first render).
- **Done after #12** (owner's ask, its own PR): the keypad's amount row shows each number
  grouped in thousands while typing (`8,500+1,000`, decimals as typed); the form still holds
  `8500` (`groupExpression` in `shared/utils/calc.ts`). A long expression is cut at its end
  (`8,500+1,000+1,2…`) as before, the result line under it in full. Initial bundle 717.1 kB.
- Headless Chromium breaks some Thai lines inside a word ("บัน/ทึก"); the app's older notices do
  the same, so it's the test browser's line breaking, not our markup.

## Done: Recurring transactions (#12)

- **Decided at the start of #12** (owner: "ตามเสนอ", round 1 of the mock-up
  `docs/features/mockups/recurring.html`; recurring.md → Open questions): the **device** records
  due occurrences when the app opens (after the first sync round, or at once offline), each rule
  **"บันทึกให้อัตโนมัติ"** or **"ถามก่อนบันทึก"** (a due card to record, edit or skip) (Q1);
  **deterministic occurrence ids** + the server keeping its row for a second create, quietly,
  and `nextOn` only moving forward (Q2); day / week / month / year with "every n", the 31st →
  the month's last day, an end by date or count (Q3); transfers repeat too (Q4); a "ทำซ้ำ" row
  under "เพิ่มเติม", Account › รายการซ้ำ + a ⋮ row, the due card, upcoming rows in "อนาคต" (Q5);
  an edit changes what isn't recorded, delete of an occurrence = skip (Q6); an archived wallet
  or category stops a rule (no catch-up), a merge moves it, a delete takes it, a live rule fixes
  currency and type (Q7); 3 months of upcoming, never counted (Q8). Extras: the toast after a
  pass, no "save and add" while repeating, 100 rules per profile.
- **Decided while building** (owner, from screenshots): no undo on a due item's "บันทึก" /
  "ข้าม"; one device's skip beats another's record of the same due item (one notice); the rules
  page's add buttons under the list; the transfer form's "ทำซ้ำ" in its own card.
- **API**: migration `0015_recurring` (`recurring_rules`, `recurring_id` on transactions and
  transfers); `features/recurring` (checks, 100 per profile, `resolve`: a merged category and
  `nextOn` only forward, `sameChange`); the sync service's optional hooks `keepsStored` (a
  create of an id the server has keeps its row, answered `overridden` with no notice) and
  `sameChange` (no notice between versions that are the same change); a category merge's
  `followUp` moves its rules; a live rule fixes a wallet's currency and a category's type;
  `isCalendarDay`; OpenAPI `SyncRecurringRuleRow`, `recurringId`.
- **Web**: local schema step 11; `core/recurring` (`RecurringService`: the recording pass in an
  effect after `SyncService.rounds()`, due / confirm / skip / confirmAll, update / pause /
  remove, `upcoming`, sweeps; `schedule.ts`; `occurrence-id.ts` (SHA-256 in plain JS, a UUID v8);
  `describe.ts`); the shell loads it with a dynamic `import()`; `layout/repeat-view`,
  `layout/repeat-row` and the `rule` / `fixRule` modes of both sheets; Account › รายการซ้ำ; the
  due card and `components/due-sheet`, upcoming rows and the ↻ mark on the Transactions tab;
  wallet / category / profile delete take or count rules; the sync sheet's fix route.
- **Found and fixed while building**: the recording pass opened a write for a due ask-first
  rule though it wrote nothing; the write re-ran the pass, so the page hung in a loop (a spec
  hangs without the fix).
- **Checked**: an HTTP script on `/sync/push` + `/pull` (a duplicate create keeps an edited and a
  skipped row, no notice; a stale `nextOn` stays forward; merge moves rules; type and currency
  locks). Playwright at 375×812 in th/en × light/dark on `npm run build`: a seeded family's rules
  recorded at open (the 31st → 30 Nov; an archived wallet's rule skipped ahead), the due card,
  sheet and edit-before-record, "อนาคต", the menu, the rules page and sheet, a rule from the
  form; two devices of one user offline across midnight (Playwright clock) recording the same
  occurrences: one row each on the server, A's edit kept, both rules on the same next date;
  `setOffline` and the API really stopped ("เซิร์ฟเวอร์ไม่ตอบ · รอ 2", synced by itself 13.9 s
  after it came back); 20,000 rows (recurring.md → Volume). Tests: API 569, web 549. Initial
  bundle 716.8 kB.
- **Known**: a rule's "บันทึกแล้ว n ครั้ง" counts its rows without an index (fine for one rule
  at a time). Reminders / push notifications wait for #17 (no server job before deploy).

## Done: Reports (#10)

- **Decided at the start of #10** (owner, three rounds of the mock-up
  `docs/features/mockups/report.html`; report.md → Open questions): by category as a thin
  split bar over a ranked list with bars (Q1-B), drawn with our own elements, **no chart
  library**; month (default) / quarter / year / custom through the ⋮ "ดูตาม", its own choice
  kept per profile, trend 6 months / 4 quarters / 5 years (Q2); the Transactions tab's wallet
  switcher and chosen wallet (Q3); money on a parent itself as "ไม่ระบุหมวดย่อย" (Q4); drill-down
  pages in the tab, rows open the transaction sheet (Q5); one currency at a time with chips
  only when needed (Q6); no API (Q7); extras ยอดเริ่มต้น / ยอดสุดท้าย (owner's wording),
  average per day, the previous period on a category page, the "ไม่รวมในรายงาน" line and page,
  not the % against the previous period; the summary card **H1** (S3's net headline and tinted
  tiles + S1's balances on one line + small chips).
- **Decided while building** (owner, from screenshots): the previous period named by its
  dates ("เทียบกับ ก.ย. 2026: 1,135.00", not "เดือนที่แล้ว", which is also a chip); a wallet with
  only transfers shows its summary (its balances moved); a category page lists only counted
  rows; no "อื่น ๆ" fold; the chips stay on the report pages.
- **Found and fixed**: the Transactions tab jumped back to "เดือนนี้" (and its remembered
  wallet) after any save or pull while another period was chosen (since 8.1):
  `ProfileService.current()` is a new object after every write or pull, which re-ran the
  effect that restores the view. `ProfileService.currentId()` now feeds it (and the report's);
  a spec fails without it.
- **Web** (no API change): `core/report` (`ReportService`: unit / tab / custom / type /
  currency, `summaries`, `breakdown`, `byCategory`, `categoryTotal`, `trend`,
  `previousRange`, balances as one `UNION ALL` aggregate); `features/reports` (the tab, the
  category and left-out pages, `components/` summary card, trend, share list, day list,
  `report-view.ts`); `TransactionService.list` filter; `layout/transactions-header` `view`
  input (`app-header` shows it on `/reports`, `parentOf` goes up a report page, the
  `PageTitleStrategy.setOverride` title); `shared/components/period` (`app-period-strip`,
  `appSwipe`, `app-custom-range-sheet` with `range` / `applied`, now used by both tabs).
- **Checked**: Playwright at 375×812 in th/en × light/dark on `npm run build` with a seeded
  family (Oct: 151,625 + 21,569 − 5,000 transfer − 1,500 left out = 166,694); the bar tap, the
  left-out page, a parent, "ไม่ระบุหมวดย่อย" and a child, quarter / year / custom, the savings
  wallet; `setOffline` (an edit moves the totals at once, synced 0.3 s after) and the API
  really stopped ("เซิร์ฟเวอร์ไม่ตอบ · รอ 1", synced by itself 15.6 s after it came back, its
  boot included); 20,000 rows (report.md → Volume: the tab ≈ 0.12 s, a period 0.09–0.15 s, a
  year of one category ≈ 0.28 s; the Transactions tab again: month ≈ 0.10 s, "ทั้งหมด" ≈ 0.47
  s). Tests: web 511 (API unchanged, 544). Initial bundle 713 kB.
- **Known**: several currencies are built but only seen in specs (only THB is active).

## Done: Category merge (7.3)

Done before Reports, so retiring a category doesn't mean moving its transactions one by one (a
category with transactions could only be archived, category rule 6). **7.3 added "ผสาน"**
(category rule 15): move a category's transactions to another one of the same type, then
delete it, from the category form in Account › หมวดหมู่ (a header icon beside archive /
delete, views in the same sheet).

- **Decided at the start of 7.3** (owner; category.md rule 15, mock-up
  `docs/features/mockups/category-merge.html`): a category merges into **any** category of the
  same profile and type, top-level or sub-category, except itself and its own children (as in
  Money Lover: "ค่าน้ำ" into "ค่าข้าว" or into "อาหาร"); a parent's children move under the
  target (or the target's parent) with a name clash merging, or all merge in; a confirm view,
  no undo; merged ids leave `hiddenCategoryIds`; the "can't delete" line offers the merge.
- **Sync, decided** (owner): the device merges locally and queues **one** op (the tombstone
  with `mergedIntoId`); the **server** moves the transactions (and leftover children) when it
  lands, and moves a late transaction pushed to the merged category instead of refusing it. No
  network needed to merge. A merge only meets a row it didn't move when one user's two devices
  are both offline (later-edit-wins can't settle it: different rows), so shared wallets (#16)
  stay on the roadmap.
- **Also decided**: archived source ok, target open; refused child moves merge into the
  target; the target keeps its own hidden state; confirm, no undo. A per-wallet move is #15's
  bulk edit, not a merge.
- **Built** (PR #26) and **tested** (the follow-up PR):
  - API: migration `0014_category_merged_into`; the sync service's optional handler hooks
    `resolve` (a pushed row adjusted before its checks) and `followUp` (rows a written row
    implies, with a block of `changeSeq`s from `takeSeqs(n)`); `core/database/category-merge.ts`
    `findMergeTarget` (≤ 5 hops, same owner, profile and type); a merged tombstone moves its
    transactions (one `UPDATE … FROM`) and merges leftover children; a late transaction, or a
    child pushed under a merged parent, follows the merge instead of being refused.
  - Web: local schema step 10 (`categories.merged_into_id`), `core/category/category-merge.ts`,
    `CategoryService.merge` / `mergePlan` / `mergeTargets` / `transactionCount`, both sweeps run
    `followMerges` first, the sheet's merge icon and `merge` / `confirmMerge` views, the
    can't-delete line with a merge link, `app-sheet-frame` `threeActions`.
  - Checked: a scenario script on the real push service (1,200 transactions merged in one op,
    23 ms; a late push and an offline child follow; a chain of merges; leftover children).
    Playwright at 375×812 on `ng serve` with the API: กาแฟ → ร้านอาหาร (17 rows, total
    unchanged), ที่อยู่อาศัย → ช้อปปิ้ง in both modes (a clash merges into ค่าไฟ, a moved child
    keeps its hidden state), dark mode; the server's rows checked after.
  - Two devices in the browser (Playwright, `ng serve` + the API): B trusted and offline adds
    to กาแฟ while A merges กาแฟ → ร้านอาหาร; B back online shows all four rows on ร้านอาหาร
    (its pending op was moved by the server, then pulled), nothing deleted, the server agrees.
  - Tests: API 544 (sync hooks, `takeSeqs`, `findMergeTarget`, both handlers, the schema),
    web 479 (`category-merge`, `CategoryService.merge`, the transaction sweep, the sheet);
    OpenAPI `SyncCategoryRow.mergedIntoId`.
- **Known**: a child move refused for a clash another offline device made (the server then
  merges that child into the target) stays in the sync sheet as a refused item until it is
  discarded; its "fix" opens a category that is gone. Rare; not handled.

## Done: Transfer (#9)

- **Decided at the start of #9** (owner, from two rounds of HTML mock-ups, transfer.md → Open
  questions): a `transfers` table of its own, one row per transfer, shown as two rows (Q1); the
  same currency only (Q2); no fee field, a fee is its own expense (Q3); its own sheet, opened
  from the ⋮ menu, now a two-level nav list "โอนเงิน · ดูตาม ›" (choice B, more items will
  join), and from the Wallets tab (Q4); two rows, the outgoing one first, **red − / green +**
  with "โอนไปยัง" / "ได้รับจาก" (Q5, replacing DESIGN.md §5's neutral transfers); editing or
  deleting either row changes the whole transfer (Q6); the to wallet remembered per from wallet
  (Q7); a "โอน" summary line when the view's transfers don't cancel out; the profile delete
  counts transfers with transactions.
- **Decided while building** (owner): the sync status is the **icon on every tab** (it was a
  word pill outside the Transactions tab); the Wallets tab's "โอนเงิน" is tinted gold so it
  doesn't look like the outline "เพิ่มกระเป๋าเงิน" (maia's `secondary` looked the same);
  "Transactions" stays the English tab label.
- **API**: migration `0013_transfers` (profile and both wallet FKs with cascade),
  `features/transfer` (sync handler; `check`: the user's live profile with no move, two
  different live wallets of it, archived accepted, the same currency); a wallet on either side
  of a live transfer keeps its currency; `isEntryDay` in `shared/utils` (transactions and
  transfers); OpenAPI `SyncTransferRow`.
- **Web**: local schema step 9, `SYNC_TABLES`, `PROFILE_CHILD_TABLES`; `core/transaction`
  `TransferService`, `TransactionService.entries` / `transferSides`, `MoneySummary.transfer`;
  balances and `hasTransactions` count both sides, a pulled wallet tombstone takes its
  transfers; `layout/transfer-sheet`; the ⋮ menu's two levels; the Wallets tab button; the sync
  sheet's refused transfer; `CALC_KEYBOARD` shared by both sheets; `app-sync-status` icon only.
- **Found and fixed**: the transaction form never dropped a category the newly chosen wallet
  hides (since 8.1: a control's `valueChanges` read a `computed` fed by the form's, which hadn't
  emitted yet; `web/AGENTS.md` → Forms); the sync sheet had no name for the transfers table.
- **Checked**: curl-style scripts on `/sync/push` + `/pull` (every check above, amount, date and
  note limits, USD switched on for the currency rules, delete then the currency is free).
  Playwright at 375×812 in th/en × light/dark on `npm run build`: add through the ⋮ menu (the
  error, the pickers, `500+500`), the two rows in "ทุกกระเป๋า" and one wallet (กสิกร: "โอน
  −9,000"), edit from the incoming row (both sides 500), delete + undo (both rows), a transfer
  to the excluded savings from the Wallets tab (ยอดรวม unchanged by internal transfers, −5,000
  line), the remembered to wallet; `setOffline` (synced 0.5 s after) and the API really stopped
  ("เซิร์ฟเวอร์ไม่ตอบ · รอ 1", synced by itself 1.5 s after it came back); an untrusted device
  offline can't save. Tests: API 527, web 464.

## Done: Transaction 8.2 (#8)

- **Decided at the start of 8.2** (owner, from an HTML mock-up): **quick amounts** as a chip row
  `20 · 50 · 100 · 500 · 1,000` at the top of the keypad's panel (keys 4px shorter), a chip
  **adds** (`500` then `100` → `500+100`), a fixed set with an on/off switch per device in
  Account › การแสดงผล (on by default); **toasts at the top** of the screen everywhere; and the
  extras the owner picked: "ใช้บ่อย" categories (a shortcut row above the tree, the tree keeps
  the user's order, so frequency and reordering don't fight), copy, save and add another, the
  last type remembered.
- **Decided while building** (owner): the keypad belongs to the amount row: it opens with it
  when adding and closes when any other control of the form is used (type tabs, date,
  เพิ่มเติม), not only the picker rows.
- **Found while building**: a toast never showed over an open sheet: CDK put overlays in the
  browser's top layer (popover), above any z-index, so toasts were drawn under the sheet's
  backdrop (8.1's "stacked toasts cover the keypad" was really this). Now `OVERLAY_DEFAULT_CONFIG`
  `usePopover: false` (`app.config.ts`) and the toaster lives beside `<body>` (`app.ts`), so a tap
  on a toast doesn't close the sheet and the sheet's `aria-hidden` doesn't hide it.
- **Web** (no API change): `shared/utils` `addQuickAmount`; `app-calc-keypad` `quickAmounts` /
  `quickPressed`; `core/transaction` `QuickAmountsService` (`tpn-quick-amounts`),
  `frequentCategoryIds()`, `lastType()` / `rememberType()`, `TransactionSheetState` create with
  `values` / `type` (copy); `layout/transaction-sheet` (chips, ใช้บ่อย, copy, save and add,
  `leaveAmount`).
- **Checked**: Playwright at 375×812 in th/en × light/dark on `npm run build` (chips, `500+100 =
600.00`, save and add, ใช้บ่อย order with ties, copy dated today, the last type, the switch
  off = 8.1's keypad, delete + undo tapped over an open sheet, the ⋮ menu and wallet sheet after
  the overlay change, the keypad closing on other controls); `setOffline` (2 rows queued, synced
  0.5 s after) and the API really stopped ("เซิร์ฟเวอร์ไม่ตอบ · รอ 2", synced by itself 17 s
  after it came back). Tests: web 439 (API unchanged, 512).

## Done: Transaction 8.1 (#8)

- **Decided at the start of #8** (owner, transaction.md → Open questions): the Money Lover
  header comes in 8.1 (no temporary month stepper); no time of day (a day's rows by
  `createdAt`); pickers leave archived wallets and categories out, the server accepts them; a
  pulled wallet or category tombstone takes its live transactions; an on-screen calculator
  keypad; "ทุกกระเป๋า" leaves out wallets excluded from the total; `excludeFromReport` kept; a row
  opens the form.
- **Decided while building** (owner, from HTML mock-ups and Money Lover screenshots): **ค.ศ. in
  the whole app** (replaces the locked พ.ศ. in Thai); the form has no labels above its rows, the
  note is its own view, "ไม่รวมในรายงาน" folds under เพิ่มเติม; the list's day cards (big date,
  weekday, month ค.ศ.), chip tabs `09/2026 · เดือนที่แล้ว · เดือนนี้ · อนาคต` and only the chosen
  period's rows; the wallet switcher in the very centre, so the sync pill is an icon on this tab;
  the wallet's badge on the category badge on "ทุกกระเป๋า" (ก); sub-categories in a panel tinted
  with the parent's colour (3+4, also in Account › หมวดหมู่ and "หมวดหมู่ที่ใช้"); the initial
  bundle warning budget 680 → 750 kB (694 kB; features after #8 are lazy).
- **API**: migration `0012_transactions` (profile, wallet, category FKs with cascade),
  `features/transaction` (sync handler; `check`: the user's live profile with no move, live
  wallet and category of that profile, no move to another currency); wallets keep their
  currency and categories their type while they have live transactions; OpenAPI
  `SyncTransactionRow`.
- **Web**: local schema step 8 (+ `(profile_id, occurred_on)`, wallet, category indexes),
  `SYNC_TABLES`, `PROFILE_CHILD_TABLES`; `core/transaction` (`TransactionService`, `period.ts`);
  real `balance()`, `hasTransactions` / `canChangeCurrency` / no delete in `WalletService` and
  `CategoryService`; `layout/transactions-header`, `view-wallet-sheet`, `custom-range-sheet`,
  `transaction-sheet`; `features/transactions`; shared `calc.ts`, `day.ts`, `formatAmount`,
  `app-calc-keypad`, `app-calc-amount-field`, `.tpn-tree`; ➕ opens the sheet.
- **Checked**: curl-style scripts on `/sync/push` + `/pull` (amount and date limits, foreign /
  deleted / other-profile wallet or category, archived accepted, currency move with USD switched
  on for the test, currency and type locks, two devices: the later edit wins). Playwright at
  375×812 in th/en × light/dark on `npm run build`: add with the keypad (`120+65` → 185), income,
  past dates, edit, delete + undo, ⋮ units, custom range, wallet switcher, the empty picker of a
  wallet hiding all income, wallet / category locks, the profile delete count; `setOffline` and
  the API really stopped (syncs by itself when back); an untrusted device offline can't save;
  two trusted devices (the later edit wins, the loser's notice); A deletes an empty wallet
  offline while B adds to it → B's row goes too; 20,000 rows (pull ≈ 5.5 s, month ≈ 0.17 s,
  "ทั้งหมด" ≈ 0.8 s after the 100-row pages; it froze for 12 s before). Tests: API 512, web 425.

## Done: Category 7.2 (#7)

- **Decided at the start of 7.2** (owner, category.md rule 13): hiding a parent stores the
  parent's id only (children follow, also later ones; their switches show off and locked), an
  archived category's id stays, ids of known tombstones and duplicates are dropped on save, a
  wallet may hide every category of a type, and the row is in the wallet form when creating and
  editing. The profile delete confirm counts categories too (rule 12, owner's request).
- **Decided while building** (owner, from HTML mock-ups): no explanation line in the categories
  view; the form rows look like "หมวดหมู่หลัก" (label left, value right, ›); **the category form
  also chooses its wallets** ("ใช้ในกระเป๋า", owner's idea: a new category used only on a credit
  card in one go), written to those wallets' `hiddenCategoryIds` in the same local write
  (later-edit-wins per wallet row as usual). The buffet icon is redrawn as a chafing dish
  (`tpnBuffet`, pick A); the first drawing stays as `tpnServingDomes`, and `tpnBuffetLine` and
  `tpnAllYouCanEat` joined the food group ("keep them all").
- **API**: migration `0011_wallet_hidden_categories` (`wallets.hidden_category_ids`, JSON text,
  default `'[]'`), the wallet schema checks the shape only (UUIDs, at most 200; absent = `[]`),
  the handler writes / pulls the array, OpenAPI `SyncWalletRow.hiddenCategoryIds`.
- **Web**: local schema step 7 + `SYNC_TABLES.wallets.json` (JSON columns: `putRow` writes
  `[]` when absent, `fromSql` parses); `core/wallet/hidden-categories.ts` (`isHiddenIn`,
  `cleanHidden`, `toWallet`, `findWallet`); `WalletService.openOf(profileId)`;
  `CategoryService.treeOf()`, `hiddenIn()`, `save(..., hiddenIn)`; the shared
  `app-toggle-list-field`; wallet sheet view `categories`, category sheet view `wallets`;
  `ProfileService.categoryCount()`.
- **Checked**: curl (no field → `[]`, two ids, 200 ok, 201 / not a UUID / not an array / null
  refused, pull, two devices from one `baseSeq`: the later edit wins and the loser's array is
  in `change_history`). Playwright at 375×812 in th/en × light/dark on `npm run build`: hide a
  parent (children locked, "ซ่อน 7" counts them), the income tab, save and reopen, the category
  form's "ใช้ในกระเป๋า" (a wallet hiding the parent is locked), the profile delete confirm
  ("กระเป๋าเงิน 2 ใบ หมวดหมู่ 27 รายการ"), the icon picker. Two devices: A offline edits first,
  B online later → B wins and A shows B's list; B first, A offline later → A wins the whole row.
  Server really stopped: a new category used only in one wallet queues 2 ops and syncs once the
  server is back. An untrusted device offline can't save. Tests: API 497, web 381.
- **Known** (fixed right after, see below): with the network up but the API down, the app
  retried only on a write, a visibility change, "sync ตอนนี้" or the 5-minute timer.

## Done: Server unreachable (after 7.2)

- **Decided** (owner, after 7.2; offline-sync rules 1 and 11): with the network up but the API
  not answering (or a proxy answering 502–504), the device marks the server unreachable and
  retries by itself after 5 s, 15 s, 30 s, 1 min and 2 min, then every 5 min, until a round gets
  through; the pill says "เซิร์ฟเวอร์ไม่ตอบ" (red) and the sync sheet says it retries by itself; an
  untrusted device can't write meanwhile (its rows would only live in memory), and its notices
  say the server is down rather than "go online".
- **Web**: `NetworkStatusService.serverReachable`, `SyncService` retries (`RETRY_DELAYS_MS`,
  also for a session check that couldn't reach the API when the app opened),
  `SyncStatus` `'unreachable'`, `ProfileService.canWrite` / `serverDown`.
- **Checked** (Playwright on `npm run build`, th and en, the API process really stopped): a
  trusted device writing while down shows "เซิร์ฟเวอร์ไม่ตอบ · รอ 1" within a second and syncs by
  itself 14–27 s after the API is back; a device opened (PIN) while down gets its session back and
  syncs by itself; an untrusted device blocks saving with the server-down notice and allows it
  again by itself. Tests: web 385.

## Done: Category 7.1 (#7)

- **Decided at the start of #7** (owner, category.md → Open questions): split 7.1 / 7.2; the
  default set follows the app's language when the profile is created; the manage screen is
  Account › หมวดหมู่ with the current profile on top (tap to switch); hiding per wallet is a
  `wallets` column; a refused profile create groups its refused child rows (categories, first
  wallet) under one sync-sheet item, fixed or discarded together. Proposed in the revision and
  kept: archived categories hold no name, at most 200 open per profile, a pulled parent
  tombstone takes its children, unarchiving a parent brings its children back.
- **Decided while building** (owner, from HTML mock-ups): **white glyphs on every user colour**:
  five palette colours went one step darker so white reaches 4.5:1 on all ten (`userColor` draws
  a row's old colour as its new one; DESIGN.md §3). The **Account tab is grouped rows that open
  pages** (option A1: ข้อมูลของฉัน — โปรไฟล์, หมวดหมู่; บัญชีและความปลอดภัย — ความปลอดภัย;
  การตั้งค่า — การแสดงผล, เครื่องนี้), and a page inside it has a ‹ in the header. The buffet
  icon doesn't read well yet; the owner is fine to redraw icons later.
- **API**: `categories` (migration `0010_categories`; `profileId` and self `parentId` FKs with
  cascade), `features/category` (pushable handler; `check`: the user's live profile and no move,
  a live top-level parent of the same profile and type, open for an open child, a parent with
  live children stays top-level and keeps its type, a unique name among open siblings, 200
  open), OpenAPI `SyncCategoryRow`, `scripts/seed-default-categories.ts` (one-off, Thai, for
  profiles with no category rows).
- **Web**: local schema step 6 (`categories`) + `SYNC_TABLES`, joined `PROFILE_CHILD_TABLES`;
  `core/category` (`CategoryService`); `ProfileService.save` writes the default set
  (`core/profile/default-categories.ts`) with a new profile, `rejectedItems()` /
  `discardRefused()` and the fix re-sending refused child rows, `switchSheet` (the switch sheet
  moved to the shell); `outbox.moveOpLast` (a category put under a parent made after it is pushed
  after it); `layout/category-sheet` + `app-segmented-field`; `features/account` pages
  categories / appearance / device and the grouped account page; the header's ‹
  (`parentOf`); 7 new `tpn` icons and `CATEGORY_ICON_GROUPS` (8 groups). The initial bundle
  warning budget went 640 → 680 kB (the header's icon badge now carries the category icons;
  662 kB).
- **Checked**: curl (create, every parent rule, sibling clash in any case, other type / parent /
  profile free, archived name free and its unarchive refused, archive with children, child of
  an archived parent refused, the 201st open, another user's profile and id, a move between
  profiles, a deleted profile or parent, pull scoping, the one-off script twice, `sync:cleanup`
  cascade). Playwright at 375×812 in th/en × light/dark on `npm run build`: the default set,
  tabs, add a sub-category through the icon and parent views, name clash, discard, a parent
  with children (type and delete locked), archive + undo, the archived fold, a child refused
  while its parent is archived, unarchive brings children back, delete confirm, order mode by
  mouse drag (parents and children), arrow keys and touch long-press (a quick swipe does
  nothing); device B (untrusted) sees A's set; A offline adds a category and a profile whose
  names B takes first → back online, two items in the sync sheet (the profile "with 27
  categories"), both fixed → synced, B sees the fixed profile with its 27; deleting a profile
  tombstones its 29 categories on the server; a **really offline** reopen (both servers
  stopped) adds a category that syncs once back; untrusted offline blocks adding. Found and
  fixed while checking: fixing a refused profile left its children rejected, and the pill
  counted them one by one. Tests: API 491, web 366.
- **Known**: the profile delete confirm counted wallets only (fixed in 7.2). Same local-proxy limits as before (20 sign-in mails per hour, the 60 s cooldown
  per email).

## Done: Profile + Wallet (#6)

Specs: [profile.md](docs/features/profile.md), [wallet.md](docs/features/wallet.md). **Decided at
the start of #6**: two parts, one session and PR each, because wallets, categories and
transactions all carry a `profileId`, so `profiles` must exist first.

| Part | What                                                                                                               | Status |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| 6.1  | `profiles` (API table + sync handler; device table), create step, profile form, header switcher, Account › โปรไฟล์ | ✅     |
| 6.2  | `wallets` + `wallet_members`, Wallets tab, wallet form + icons, first-wallet step, **remove `sync_probes`**        | ✅     |

Decided with the owner (don't re-ask):

- **Profiles are made by the user.** No automatic profile or wallet (replaces wallet rule 7).
  Onboarding = create a profile → its first wallet. The app reopens on the device's last
  profile (`tpn-profile:<userId>`, profile rule 6).
- **Profile look** (6.1): a lucide icon from a curated set on a user colour. The switcher
  replaces the page title on the Transactions, Wallets and Reports tabs. Delete asks in a sheet
  (no undo, takes the profile's wallets and transactions with it from 6.2); the last profile may
  be deleted.
- **Categories**: one set per profile, and a wallet can hide categories it doesn't use. The
  default set (category rule 8) comes with #7, written by the device that creates the profile
  in the same local write; 6.1 writes no categories.
- **For 6.2** (wallet.md revised before it): wallets have **no type** (drop `type`); icons are
  lucide **plus our own `tpn` SVGs** in lucide's style where lucide lacks a clear picture, chosen
  to say what the thing is (several bank and card drawings instead of bank logos; **no letter
  badges**, dropped before 6.2), so DESIGN.md §7's "lucide only" changes with it; a new wallet
  gets a default icon the user can change; names are unique within the profile; archive is
  built in 6.2; the currency can change only while the wallet has no transactions, and the form
  says why when it can't.
- **For #8** (owner's direction): the Transactions tab's wallet switcher sits at the header
  centre and a ⋮ menu at the right holds the time range (day / month by default / quarter / year
  / all / custom); layout confirmed with a mock-up at #8's start (transaction.md → Open
  questions).
- 6.1 leaves out: `wallets` / `wallet_members`, the Wallets tab, the `tpn` icon set and removing
  `sync_probes` (all 6.2).

6.2 in detail (✅ done, API + web):

- **Decided at its start** (owner, wallet.md → Open questions): at most **20 open wallets per
  profile** (archiving frees a place); a **+/− button** for a negative starting balance (phone
  keypads have no minus); a device that pulls a profile's tombstone **tombstones that profile's
  wallets it holds** (a wallet another device synced survives a delete made where it wasn't
  known). The revised spec had been pushed after 6.1's PR merged, so 6.2 cherry-picked it.
- **Decided while building** (owner, from HTML mock-ups): **every sheet is 92dvh** with a header
  bar (X / ‹ left, title centred, icon actions right) and **one main button pinned at the
  bottom** (no "ปิด"); the wallet and profile forms are **compact** (icon + name on one row, the
  icon opening an "ไอคอนและสี" view, no labels or hints); archive and delete are header icons,
  delete and discard are confirm views, **archiving offers undo** in its toast; the Wallets
  tab's total sits 12px above the list. The currency stays per wallet (locked decision): the form
  shows "THB" and becomes a picker only when a second currency is active. DESIGN.md §6–8 hold the
  rules.
- **API**: `wallets` + empty `wallet_members` (migration `0007_wallets`; `profileId` FK with
  cascade, so purging a profile's old tombstone takes its wallets'), `features/wallet` (pushable
  handler; `check`: the user's live profile, no move between profiles, an active currency for a
  new or changed one, a unique name among the profile's open wallets, 20 open), OpenAPI
  `SyncWalletRow`. `sync_probes` removed: feature, schema, `0008` drops the table, custom `0009`
  deletes its `change_history` rows.
- **Web**: local schema step 4 (`wallets`) and step 5 (drop `sync_probes` with its ops and
  notices); `core/wallet` (`WalletService`); `features/wallets` (Wallets tab: totals per
  currency, list, order mode, folded "เก็บถาวร"); `layout/wallet-sheet` + `wallet-first-step`
  (the shell's gate on the Transactions and Wallets tabs, ➕ follows); `ProfileService` deletes a
  profile's wallets in the same write, counts them for the confirm and sweeps orphans
  (`PROFILE_CHILD_TABLES`); `shared/components/sheet` (`app-sheet-frame`, now under all four
  sheets), `app-name-icon-field`, `app-amount-field`, the grouped `app-icon-field`, the first
  `tpn` SVG set + `WALLET_ICON_GROUPS`, `shared/utils/money`. Account › Sync test is gone. The
  initial bundle warning budget went 620 → 640 kB (the header's icon badge carries every user
  icon; now 623 kB).
- **Checked**: curl (create, every validation, `ID_TAKEN`, another user's profile, a deleted
  profile, a move, inactive / unknown currency, a case-insensitive name clash, an archived
  duplicate allowed and its unarchive refused, the 21st wallet, `overridden`, pull scoping,
  `sync:cleanup` cascade; after removal `tables` has no probe and a probe push is
  `UNKNOWN_TABLE`). Playwright at 375×812 in th/en × light/dark on `npm run build`: create step
  → profile → first-wallet step → wallets (negative, excluded, archived, every `tpn` icon), totals,
  order mode by mouse drag, touch long-press (a quick swipe does nothing) and arrow keys, kept
  after reload; device B (untrusted) sees A's wallets; A offline adds a name B adds online first
  → rejected → fix from the sync sheet → synced on both; deleting a profile with wallets (the
  confirm counts them; B's wallet A never saw is swept); untrusted offline blocks writing; a
  **really offline** reopen (both servers stopped) adds a wallet that syncs once back; archive +
  undo, unarchive refused, delete and discard confirms, the icon view. Tests: API 468, web 320.
- **Known**: archived wallets' fold state isn't kept across visits. When the API is down but the
  browser stays online, the session is re-checked only on an `online` event or an unlock, so a
  queued op waits for one of those (from 4a; noticed here). The ±10¹⁵ balance check counts the
  digits typed, so a starting balance never loses precision but a 17-digit paste is refused as a
  format error. Same local-proxy limits as before (20 sign-in mails per hour, the 60 s cooldown
  per email).

6.1 in detail (✅ done, API + web):

- **Decided at its start** (owner): split #6 into 6.1 / 6.2; the category default set waits for
  #7 (written with the profile on the device); profile look = curated lucide icon on a user
  colour; the switcher replaces the page title on the three data tabs; delete asks in a sheet and
  the last profile may go. **While building**: up to 20 profiles and a name unique among live
  ones (both server checks, `CONFLICT`); the current profile lives in `localStorage` on a trusted
  device and `sessionStorage` on an untrusted one, and a wipe forgets it; reorder = an order mode
  with **one grip handle per row** (press and hold ~0.3 s on touch, ↑ / ↓ for keyboards; owner's
  choice over up / down buttons); a fixed refused create becomes current again; swiping or
  tapping away a sheet with unsaved input brings it back asking "ทิ้งที่แก้ไว้ใช่ไหม" (spartan's
  `disableClose` is read only when the drawer opens); the **tab bar shows the active tab by
  colour alone** (no pill; owner picked option B of four mock-ups).
- **API**: `profiles` (migration `0006_profiles`), `features/profile` registers a pushable sync
  handler (validate / find / check / write / purge, like `sync-probe`), no REST routes; OpenAPI
  `SyncProfileRow`.
- **Web**: local schema step 3 (`profiles`) + `SYNC_TABLES`; `core/profile` (`ProfileService`:
  list, `current()`, `ready()`, `canWrite()`, `save` / `remove` / `moveTo`, sheet state,
  `openFix`); `layout/` gained the header switcher + switch sheet, the profile sheet (deferred),
  the create step the shell shows on the data tabs while there is no profile (a spinner until a
  new device's first pull) and the ➕ redirect; `features/account/pages/profiles-page`;
  `shared/components/icon-badge` (`app-icon-badge`, `PROFILE_ICONS`, `USER_COLORS`,
  `glyphColor`) and the shared `app-icon-field` / `app-color-field`. The initial bundle warning
  budget went 600 → 620 kB (the header needs the profile icon set at start).
- **Checked**: curl (create, case-insensitive name clash, every validation, another user's id,
  the 21st profile, delete then reuse the name, an older edit `overridden`, pull scoping,
  `sync:cleanup`). Playwright at 375×812 in th/en × light/dark on `npm run build`: create step →
  sheet (errors, icon, colour) → no-wallet step; device B (untrusted) sees A's profile; A adds
  from the switcher and it becomes current; reopen (PIN) lands on the last profile, also after
  switching; B keeps its own current profile; A offline adds a name B adds online first →
  rejected → fix from the sync sheet → renamed and synced; order mode by mouse drag, touch
  long-press (a quick swipe does nothing) and arrow keys, kept after sync and reload; delete
  with confirm, B told "ถูกลบจากเครื่องอื่น"; delete all → create step, ➕ follows; a **really
  offline** reopen (both servers stopped) keeps the last profile and queues an add that syncs
  once back; untrusted offline blocks editing. Tests: API 454, web 279.
- **Known**: a mouse "swipe" on the sheet in headless Chromium doesn't close it, so the swipe
  path was only checked through Escape / backdrop (same handler); try it on a phone. Through one
  local proxy every browser shares the 20 sign-in mails per hour (empty `rate_limit_buckets` as
  before). The sign-in mail's 60 s cooldown applies to the second device of the same email.

## Done: Offline sync foundation (#4a)

Spec: [docs/features/offline-sync.md](docs/features/offline-sync.md). **Decided at the start of
#4a**: two parts, one PR each; local DB = SQLite WASM in memory + one encrypted snapshot in
IndexedDB (spike numbers in the spec's Open questions); one tab at a time; an expired session keeps
the app usable on local data with a "sign in again to sync" banner.

| Part | What                                                                                          | Status |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 4a.1 | Trust step, encrypted local DB, PIN lock (keypad), auto-lock, wipe rules, Security › device   | ✅     |
| 4a.2 | Sync tables, `/sync/push` + `/sync/pull`, outbox, sync status, rejected ops, conflict notices | ✅     |

The dev-only probe below was removed in 6.2 (feature folder, handler, web page, local table, and
migrations dropping `sync_probes` and its history).

4a.2 in detail (✅ done, API + web):

- **Decided at its start**: Currency (#5) folded in as pull-only master data (rows from a
  migration, since production needs them); push proven by a temporary **dev-only**
  `sync_probes` table with a test page (Account › Sync test, shown while the server lists the
  table), not a test-only table, so outbox, offline, two devices, conflicts and rejections can be
  tried in the real app; the sync status is **one header pill** that replaces the online/offline
  pill.
- **API**: `core/sync` registry (per-table handler: `pull`, and for pushable tables `validate`,
  `find`, `check`, `write`, `purge`), `features/sync` (`/sync/push`, `/sync/pull`, conflict rules
  in the service, `sync_state` counter, `sync_ops`, `change_history`, `npm run sync:cleanup`),
  `features/currency` (`GET /currencies`, pull-only handler), `features/sync-probe` (dev only).
  `GoneError` (410) joined the domain errors. Migrations `0004_offline_sync`, `0005_currency_seed`.
- **Web**: local schema step 2 (`currencies`, `sync_probes`, `outbox`, `sync_notices`);
  `outbox.ts` (one pending op per row), `sync-tables.ts` (camelCase ↔ snake_case),
  `SyncService` (rounds under the `tpn-sync` Web Lock on open / online / foreground / 2 s after
  a write / every 5 min), `OfflineService.openUntrusted()` (untrusted devices sync an in-memory
  copy, online only), `changes` / `isOpen` signals; `layout/sync-status` (pill) +
  `layout/sync-sheet` (spartan drawer, loaded on first open); sign-out pushes first and asks
  before losing ops. The initial bundle warning budget went 550 → 600 kB: the drawer's CDK
  overlay lands in the main bundle even though the sheet is deferred (every later bottom sheet
  needs it anyway).
- **Decided while building**: a quiet device's pull cursor jumps to the server's latest
  `changeSeq` (read before the rows), else it falls below the purge watermark and gets `410` on
  every round; a newer write replaces an in-flight op with a new `opId`, and the old op's answer
  moves the newer op's `baseSeq`; a `rejected` op restores the server's row locally and keeps the
  refused values for "fix"; the sheet shows the translated reason by `code`, never the server's
  English message; devices pull every currency (inactive too) and filter themselves.
- **Checked**: curl (applied, retried `opId`, clamped future times, overridden / later edit wins
  / tie, delete beats edit, undo, every rejection code, another user's row and `opId`, paging,
  per-device notices, `sync:cleanup` then `410`). Playwright at 375×812 in th/en × light/dark on
  `npm run build`: add → "รอ sync 1" → "sync แล้ว"; two devices of one user (A offline edits and
  adds; B edits the same row later and adds the same title; A back online → overridden with a
  notice + a rejected op; fix from the sheet; a later edit wins and the losing device gets the
  notice on pull; delete + undo synced); sign-out with a rejected op asks first; an untrusted
  device syncs online and can't write offline; a **really offline** reopen of a trusted device
  (web server stopped) adds a pending row that syncs once back. Tests: API 437, web 242 (specs
  run the real SQLite build from `node_modules`).
- **Known**: the probe page and table were temporary (removed in 6.2). Sharing rules 13–16 (owner
  wins, editor offline adds) arrive with #16. `change_history` isn't purged yet. The sync pill
  doesn't say "sign in again" itself; the expired-session banner does.

4a.1 in detail (✅ done, web only):

- **API**: no change. `/auth/refresh` already tells `SESSION_REVOKED` (and `USER_DISABLED`) from
  `SESSION_EXPIRED`, which decides wipe vs keep (spec rule 7).
- **Web**: `core/offline`: `LocalDatabase` (SQLite WASM in memory, schema steps by
  `PRAGMA user_version`; 4a.1 only has `sync_meta`), `vault-crypto` (AES-GCM data key, AES-KW wrap
  by a PBKDF2-SHA256 600k PIN key), `vault-storage` (IndexedDB `tpn-vault`: clear meta +
  one sealed snapshot), `OfflineService` (trust, unlock, lock, change PIN, wipe, coalesced saves,
  auto-lock after 5 min idle or in the background, one tab via the `tpn-local-db` Web Lock +
  BroadcastChannel takeover, wipe on `revoked`). `shellGuard` replaces `authGuard` on the shell;
  `trustGuard`, `lockGuard`, `otherTabGuard` guard `/auth/trust`, `/auth/lock`, `/auth/tab`.
  `AuthStore` gained `endedBy`, `freshSignIn`, `keepsLocalSession`; `AuthService` gained
  `finishGoogleSignIn()` and `signOutOrLater()` (a sign-out made offline is kept in
  `tpn-sign-out-pending` and sent at the next start before any refresh). Shared `app-pin-pad` /
  `app-pin-setup`; `/account/pin` (turn on / change PIN); the Security page's "This device" group;
  the expired-session banner under the header. The wasm is copied to `/sqlite/` and prefetched by
  the service worker; the initial bundle warning budget is 550 kB.
- **Decided while building**: the current PIN is checked as soon as it's typed on the change-PIN
  page (a wrong one counts toward the 5); 5 wrong PINs also sign the device out (now or, offline,
  at the next start), so a wiped device can't walk back in online; the lock screen's "forgot
  PIN" signs out and wipes after asking.
- **Checked**: curl for the refresh codes the wipe rules read (revoked after sign-out, expired with
  no cookie, sign-out without a cookie answers `200`). Playwright at 375×812 in th/en ×
  light/dark on `npm run build` (service worker on): trust step (installed / tab defaults, iOS
  note), PIN set + mismatch, lock + warning from the 3rd wrong PIN, a **really offline** reopen
  (web and API stopped: the SW serves the shell and the wasm, PIN unlocks, lazy tabs open), the
  5th wrong PIN offline (wiped, sign-out sent once back online, the old cookie then
  `SESSION_REVOKED`), expired session → banner → same user signs in with data kept, another user
  → wipe → their trust step, revoked elsewhere → wipe, second tab → "use here" hand-over,
  auto-lock at 5 min idle (clock fast-forwarded), change PIN, turn offline off. Tests: web 194
  (vault crypto, `OfflineService` on an in-memory vault and fake database, guards, auth store /
  service / interceptor changes, PIN pad / setup, lock / trust / PIN pages, banner, Security
  page group); API unchanged (374).
- **Known**: Playwright's `setOffline` doesn't cut the service worker's network, so offline checks
  stop the servers instead. Each tab holds its own unlocked copy, so taking over in another tab
  asks for the PIN again. (Untrusted devices open the in-memory database since 4a.2.) Someone with DevTools on an unlocked browser profile can still use the
  refresh cookie online; the PIN protects the local data, not the session (spec rule 4's honest
  limit). Each unlock costs ~0.3 s of PBKDF2 on a laptop, more on an old phone.

## Done: Auth (#4)

Spec: [docs/features/auth.md](docs/features/auth.md). Built in five parts (4.4 was split in two at
its start), one PR each, API and web together. The endpoints table in the spec says which part each
route belongs to.

| Part | What                                                                                     | Status |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 4.1  | Email code + magic link, open sign-up, sessions (refresh rotation), sign-out, `/auth/me` | ✅     |
| 4.2  | Optional password (Argon2id, breach check), recent-auth rule + step-up code              | ✅     |
| 4.3  | Google sign-in (OIDC + PKCE)                                                             | ✅     |
| 4.4a | Account → Security: sessions, sign out others, link / unlink Google, credential mail     | ✅     |
| 4.4b | Phone OTP: add / change / remove a number, sign in with phone (console SMS provider)     | ✅     |

4.1 in detail (✅ done):

- **API**: tables `users`, `otp_challenges`, `sessions` (with `authTime`), `rate_limit_buckets`
  (`user_identities` comes with 4.3, `password_credentials` with 4.2). Endpoints
  `POST /auth/email/start`, `POST /auth/email/verify`, `POST /auth/refresh`, `POST /auth/sign-out`,
  `GET /auth/me`. `authenticate` middleware, `trust proxy`, `__Host-rt` cookie, Origin check,
  DB-backed limits, mail through `notifier` in the UI language. New env: `JWT_SECRET`,
  `OTP_PEPPER` (random values from `setup-env`), `WEB_ORIGIN`, `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS`,
  `SIGNUP_ENABLED`, `EMAIL_DAILY_LIMIT`. Cleanup (rule 20) as the npm script `auth:cleanup`; its
  cron endpoint waits for #17.
- **Web**: sign-in, enter-code (`app-otp-field`) and magic-link (`/auth/link`) pages outside the
  shell; auth store (access token in memory), API client + interceptor (refresh once on 401, then
  sign-in), auth guard, silent refresh at start, sign-out on the account page.
- **Checks**: curl in the sandbox (start → code from stdout → verify → refresh → sign-out, plus
  wrong, expired, reused codes and limits), Playwright at 375×812 (light/dark, th/en), then tests +
  OpenAPI once the owner confirms the behaviour.
- **Not in 4.1**: password, Google, phone, trusted device / PIN / local DB (#4a), invitations (#16).
- **Checked**: curl against the dev API (mail read from stdout) for the happy path and every
  error path, limit and the closed-sign-up / daily-cap configs; Playwright at 375×812 in th/en ×
  light/dark for code and link sign-in, reload (silent refresh), sign-out, three tabs refreshing
  at once, and the interceptor's refresh-and-retry. Tests: API 147 (service on an in-memory repo,
  HTTP, Drizzle adapter on SQLite, core security/errors), web 40 (auth service, interceptor,
  guards, error messages).
- **Known**: through `ng serve`'s proxy every browser is `127.0.0.1`, so the per-IP limit (20
  starts/hour) is shared by everything you test locally; empty `rate_limit_buckets` in
  `api/data/local.db` if you hit it. Opening the built app offline with a session (start-up
  refresh unreachable) was only checked in `ng serve`, where there's no service worker.

4.2 in detail (✅ done):

- **Decided at the start of 4.2**: password = 8–128 characters with lower + upper + digit + other
  (owner's choice over NIST's 15+, spec rule 11), plus the HIBP breach check
  (`PASSWORD_BREACH_CHECK=hibp|off`, `HIBP_API_URL` for a local stand-in; fail open after 3 s) and
  "not the email". Recent auth = `authTime` ≤ 10 min, the current password, or a **step-up code**
  (`/auth/reauth/start` + `/verify`, code-only mail, updates `authTime` of the current family).
  The password screen is `/account/password`, opened from a short "Security" section on the
  account page until 4.4.
- **API**: table `password_credentials` (Argon2id PHC string via `@node-rs/argon2`, m = 19 MiB,
  t = 2, p = 1, rehash on sign-in when the parameters change), `otp_challenges.purpose` gains
  `reauth`. Endpoints `POST /auth/password/sign-in`, `PUT` / `DELETE /auth/password`,
  `POST /auth/reauth/start` / `verify`; `hasPassword` on every `user`. Failure limits 5 per email
  and 30 per IP per 15 min; `PUT` revokes every other session family.
- **Web**: "Sign in with password" link + `/auth/password` page; account → Security row →
  `/account/password` (set / change / remove, re-auth step in place).
- **Not in 4.2**: Google, phone, sessions list / sign out others (4.4), mail on password change
  (backlog), trusted device / PIN (#4a).
- **Form rules that came out of the review** (web/DESIGN.md §6): one error message at a time (a
  server error clears once the user edits the form), field hints and errors 4px under the input,
  server error lines 8px under the field.
- **Checked**: curl against the dev API with a local HIBP stand-in (every policy code, set →
  other device `SESSION_REVOKED` → password sign-in, recent auth by time / current password /
  step-up code, wrong / reused / other user's codes, same answer and timing for wrong password,
  unknown email and no password, both failure limits with `Retry-After`, disabled user, rehash,
  HIBP slow / down / `off`, no password in any log); Playwright at 375×812 in th/en × light/dark
  for the whole flow. Tests: API 218 (service, HTTP, Drizzle adapter, Argon2 helpers, HIBP
  checker against a local server), web 67 (auth service, policy validator, error keys, the
  password page's confirm step).
- **Known**: the step-up mail shares the sign-in mail's 60 s cooldown (spec rule 13), which only
  shows when a test ages a session by hand. The policy is checked in the browser too, so a change
  to `PASSWORD_POLICY` goes in both `api/…/auth.const.ts` and `web/…/core/auth/password-policy.ts`.

4.3 in detail (✅ done):

- **Decided at the start of 4.3** (spec rule 14): tested in the sandbox against a **local OIDC
  stand-in** (`npm run dev:oidc` in `api/`, its issuer set by `GOOGLE_ISSUER`); an existing user
  with the same verified email is **linked automatically** and the web shows a one-time notice;
  Google's name and picture are used **only when the user is created** (linking only fills an
  empty avatar); callback errors show on the web's `/auth/callback` page (`?error=<reason>`);
  the button sits under the email form after an "or" divider; the account page gets a read-only
  "Google · linked" row; the web asks `GET /auth/providers` whether Google is on.
- **API**: table `user_identities`; `GET /auth/providers`, `GET /auth/google/start`,
  `GET /auth/google/callback`; `identities` on every `user`. New env: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`,
  `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_ISSUER`. `core/security` gained an OIDC client
  (`oidc-client.ts`: discovery, code exchange, ID token check) and a sealed JWE box
  (`sealed-box.ts`) for the `__Host-goidc` round-trip cookie.
- **Web**: "Continue with Google" on sign-in, `/auth/callback`, the account page row. spartan
  `sonner` was added; the toaster lives in the app root, lifted above the tab bar.
- **Checked**: curl against the dev API and `dev:oidc` for new user, second sign-in, linking (name
  kept, empty avatar filled, `linked=google` once), `/auth/me`, every broken token (aud, issuer,
  expiry, signature, nonce), state mismatch, missing cookie, code replay, provider down, unverified
  email, cancel, sign-up closed (strangers refused, existing users and linking still work),
  disabled user, the per-IP limit, unsafe `returnUrl`s and no env (`404`). Playwright at 375×812
  in th/en × light/dark for the button, the round trip to `returnUrl`, the account row, the link
  toast, the error pages, cancel, Google off and offline. Tests: API 286 (service on a fake
  provider, HTTP, OIDC client against a local provider with real RS256 keys, sealed box, env,
  Drizzle adapter), web 85 (providers + start URL, callback page, sign-in button).
- **Known**: one Google round trip per browser at a time: starting a second one in another tab
  replaces the `__Host-goidc` cookie, so finishing the first ends in `error=failed`. The button
  is our outline style with Google's real "G" mark, not Google's white / dark button. A real
  Google client (Cloud Console, redirect URI `<WEB_ORIGIN>/api/auth/google/callback`) is set up
  at deploy (#17); until then only the stand-in has been used.
- **Not in 4.3**: linking Google while signed in, unlinking (4.4), mail on linking (backlog "Mail
  on credential change").

4.4 (decided at its start, spec rules 21–31; 4.4a and 4.4b ✅ done):

- **Split**: 4.4a (Security page, sessions, Google link / unlink, mail on credential change) and
  4.4b (phone OTP) are separate sessions and PRs, 4.4a first.
- **Security page** `/account/security`: one "Security" row on the account page opens it; two
  groups, "Ways to sign in" (password → `/account/password`, phone → `/account/phone` in 4.4b,
  Google with Link / Unlink in the row) and "Signed-in devices" (sessions + "Sign out other
  devices"). The confirm step (`reauth-step`) runs in place.
- **Sessions** (rule 28): device from the user agent (parsed on the web), signed in at, last
  active, "This device"; revoking one or all others needs **no** recent auth. `sessions` gains
  `signedInAt` (copied on rotation), since the family's first row is deleted by cleanup.
- **Google link** (rule 29): `POST /auth/google/link` needs recent auth and returns the Google
  URL (the round-trip cookie carries `mode: link`); one Google per user; a Google account linked
  to someone else is refused (`google_in_use`), never merged; its email need not match. Back on
  `/account/security`. **Unlink** (rule 30) needs recent auth.
- **Mail on credential change** (rule 31): password set / changed / removed, Google linked
  (including automatic linking) / unlinked, phone added / changed / removed; no link, no code;
  language from `lang` in the request; never blocks the change.
- **Phone (4.4b)**: `GET /auth/providers` gains `phone` (`SMS_PROVIDER` ≠ `disabled`), and
  `/auth/phone*` answer `503` before any lookup when it's off; one Thai-style `tel` field shown as
  `081-234-5678`; Thai SMS of one segment (≤ 70 UTF-16 units, rule 26).
- **API (4.4a)**: `sessions.signedInAt` (migration 0003, hand-edited: SQLite can't add a NOT NULL
  column to a table with rows; old rows get it from the absolute expiry). `GET` / `DELETE
/auth/sessions`, `DELETE /auth/sessions/:id`, `POST` / `DELETE /auth/google/link`. The Google
  round-trip cookie may now carry `link: { userId, sessionFamilyId }` and `lang`; the callback asks
  `googleFlowMode()` which way to go. Credential changes take `lang`; `notifyCredentialChange`
  sends the mail of rule 31. New error codes `CURRENT_SESSION`, `IDENTITY_ALREADY_LINKED`,
  `GOOGLE_IN_USE`.
- **Web (4.4a)**: `/account/security` (`features/account/pages/security-page`), the account
  page's single Security row, `deviceLabel()` (user agent → "Chrome · Android"), and `ReauthFlow`
  (`features/account/reauth-flow.ts`): the confirm-step state, provided per page and shared by the
  password and Security pages.
- **Checked (4.4a)**: curl against the dev API and `dev:oidc` for the session list (order, current,
  `signedInAt` kept on refresh), revoke one / own (`400`) / unknown / someone else's (`404`), sign
  out others and the revoked devices' `SESSION_REVOKED`; Google link with recent auth by step-up
  code and by password, `IDENTITY_ALREADY_LINKED`, `google_in_use`, cancel, bad signature and
  nonce, session revoked or user disabled during the round trip, the per-IP limit; unlink and its
  no-op; mails in th / en (also for an automatic link), the daily cap skipping the mail but not the
  change; migration 0003 on a table with rows. Playwright at 375×812 in th/en × light/dark for the
  page, the revoke confirm, the link round trip + toast, unlink by password and by email code, the
  in-use error, sign out others and offline. Tests: API 323 (service, HTTP, Drizzle adapter, mail
  builder), web 104 (auth service, device label, Security page).
- **Known (4.4a)**: a current-password proof covers one request only (as in 4.2): linking right
  after unlinking with a password asks again; a step-up code covers 10 minutes. The device name is
  a hint from the user agent: an iPad on Safari says "Safari · Mac", and a PWA looks like its
  browser. "Last active" moves on sign-in and refresh, not on every API call. A signed-out
  device's access token still works for its last ≤ 10 minutes (rule 28). A long "last active"
  wraps the device row to three lines at 375px; the owner accepted that.
- **Not in 4.4a**: phone OTP (4.4b, rules 21–27: the `console` SMS provider, `/auth/phone*`,
  `providers.phone`, `/account/phone`, `/auth/phone`), the ThaiBulkSMS adapter (backlog), trusted
  device / PIN / local DB (#4a), invitations (#16).

4.4b in detail (✅ done):

- **Decided at the start of 4.4b** (spec rules 21–27, 31): the mail on a phone change names the
  last 4 digits; `/account/phone` stays put after a confirm (a "saved" line, like the password
  page); the saved number typed again is refused before any SMS (`422 PHONE_UNCHANGED`); the
  sign-in page's "Sign in with phone number" sits at the bottom under "Sign in with password".
  Also settled: the daily SMS cap is checked on every start but counted per SMS sent, sign-in and
  add-number starts share the per-number / per-IP buckets, the `503` carries `PHONE_DISABLED`,
  `POST /auth/phone/confirm` needs no recent auth (the code was sent after it).
- **API**: `POST /auth/phone/start` + `/verify` (5-min SMS code, `202` and the minimum time for
  any number, nothing stored for an unknown one), `POST /auth/phone` (recent auth) +
  `/confirm` (`409 PHONE_IN_USE`, the code used up), `DELETE /auth/phone`; `phone` on every
  `user`, `providers.phone`. A `phoneGate` answers `503` in front of every `/auth/phone*` while
  `SMS_PROVIDER=disabled`. `otp_challenges` rows now carry their `channel` (the repository's
  challenge methods take an optional channel, plus `*UserChallenge` methods for
  `verify_phone`); no migration (the columns existed since 4.1). New env `SMS_DAILY_LIMIT`
  (default 100). `normalizeThaiMobile` / `maskPhone` in `shared/utils/phone.ts`; numbers are
  masked in logs and `phone` is redacted from error logs. SMS texts in `auth.mail.ts`
  (`buildPhoneSms`, 63 UTF-16 units).
- **Web**: `/auth/phone` (`PhoneSignInPage`) → the shared `/auth/code` screen in SMS mode
  (`AuthFlowStore.pending().phone`); `/account/phone` (`PhonePage`: number → SMS code with a
  resend timer, remove after asking, confirm step in place); a phone row on the Security page
  (read-only while SMS is off). `core/auth/phone.ts` mirrors the API's normaliser and adds
  `formatThaiMobile` (`081-234-5678`) and `thaiMobileValidator`.
- **Checked**: curl against the dev API with SMS read from stdout for add / change / remove,
  sign-in, wrong / locked / expired / reused codes, recent auth by step-up code and by password,
  every limit (cooldown, 3 per number, 10 per IP with unknown numbers counted, verify per IP,
  the daily cap for known and unknown numbers), another user's number (`409`), a disabled user
  (no SMS; `403` after the code), `SMS_PROVIDER=disabled` (`503` before token and body) and the
  same timing for known and unknown numbers; Playwright at 375×812 in th/en × light/dark for
  the Security row, the phone page (every state), sign-in by phone and SMS off. Tests: API 374
  (service, HTTP, Drizzle adapter, phone helpers, SMS length, redaction), web 134 (phone
  helpers, auth service, phone page, Security row, sign-in link, phone sign-in, SMS code
  screen).
- **Known**: through `ng serve`'s proxy every browser is one IP, so the 10 SMS starts per hour
  per IP is easy to hit while testing; empty `rate_limit_buckets` as in 4.1. Asking for a code
  for a number another user holds still costs one SMS: the `409` comes only at confirm
  (decided, rule 25). Only the `console` SMS provider has been used; the ThaiBulkSMS adapter
  waits for its account (backlog).

## Done: App shell (#3)

Web only: an installable PWA skeleton that opens offline, before any data feature exists.

1. **PWA**: ✅ `@angular/pwa`. `ngsw-config.json` prefetches the app shell (HTML, all JS chunks
   including lazy pages, CSS, icons) and has **no `dataGroups`**, so API responses are never
   cached; `/api/**` is also excluded from navigation fallback. `public/manifest.webmanifest`:
   `ตังค์ไปไหน`, `standalone`, portrait, `any` + `maskable` icons (`public/icons/`), plus an
   `apple-touch-icon`. `core/pwa/app-update.service.ts` shows "มีเวอร์ชันใหม่ → โหลดใหม่" under the
   header on `VERSION_READY` (also on an unrecoverable SW state) and re-checks for a new version
   whenever the app comes back to the foreground. The SW is off in `ng serve`; test PWA behaviour
   on `npm run build` output.
2. **Storage persistence helper**: ✅ `core/pwa/device-storage.service.ts`: `persist()`,
   `isPersisted`, `isInstalled` (`display-mode: standalone` or iOS `navigator.standalone`). Nothing
   calls `persist()` yet: #4a does, at the trust prompt. The account page shows both values.
3. **Bottom tab bar**: ✅ `layout/` (`AppShell` is the layout route; header + page + fixed bar).
   ธุรกรรม / กระเป๋า / raised ➕ (→ `/transactions/new`) / รายงาน / บัญชีผู้ใช้, each a lazy feature
   route with an empty page. Safe-area insets on header and bar; `core/viewport/keyboard.service.ts`
   hides the bar when the visual viewport shrinks by > 150px (on-screen keyboard).
4. **Dark mode**: ✅ `core/theme/theme.service.ts`, key `tpn-theme` (absent = system). An inline
   script in `index.html` applies it before boot (no white flash) and sets `theme-color`. The picker
   lives on the account page.
5. **Online/offline indicator**: ✅ `core/network` + `layout/network-status.ts` in the header. It
   becomes the sync status in #4a.
6. **Checked**: `npm run build` emits `ngsw-worker.js`. Served from `dist/` with an SPA fallback,
   Playwright (375×812, light and dark) opened the app once, went offline, reloaded and saw the tab
   bar and "ออฟไลน์", and opened lazy tabs offline. It also checked the theme override survives a
   reload, the bar hides with a shrunk visual viewport, and the update banner appears after a new
   build is deployed and reloads into it.

Known behaviour: Angular's SW only announces a new version to pages it served, so the very first
visit (before the SW controlled the page) sees the update on its next reload, not as a banner.

## Done: Local dev workflow (#1)

Goal: every feature can be built **and tested** inside a Claude Code sandbox (or the owner's PC),
with no deploy and no third-party API keys.

1. **API**: `cd api && npm run setup-env && npm run dev` serves `http://localhost:3000`. `.env.dev`
   holds only local values. Secrets the app itself needs (JWT secret, `OTP_PEPPER`, …) are random
   values generated by `setup-env`, not keys from an outside service.
2. **Web**: ✅ `cd web && npm start` serves `http://localhost:4200`. `web/proxy.conf.json` forwards
   `/api/*` to `http://localhost:3000` and strips the `/api` prefix (`/api/health` → `/health`), the
   same mapping the prod rewrite will use. The browser sees one origin in dev as in prod, so the web
   calls relative `/api/...` URLs (no `apiUrl` in an environment file) and the auth cookie behaves
   the same. Node: Angular CLI needs `^22.22.3 || >=24.15`; the repo pins **24** in `.nvmrc` (same
   as CI).
3. **Database**: local SQLite file `api/data/local.db` (gitignored), set up in #2.
4. **Notifications**: ✅ `core/notification` (see `api/AGENTS.md` §2). One `notifier`, two channels
   (email, SMS), provider chosen by env:
   - `EMAIL_PROVIDER=console` (default) prints mail (to, subject, text with the code and link) to
     **stdout**, not through the app logger, so log files never hold codes (auth rule 18).
     `EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp` + `SMTP_URL` sends via **Nodemailer** (e.g. a local Mailpit at
     `smtp://localhost:1025`, no API key).
   - `SMS_PROVIDER=console` (default) prints the SMS; `disabled` makes sends fail with `503`.
   - `console` providers are refused when `NODE_ENV=production`.
5. **Features that need an outside key stay off** until their env vars are set: Google sign-in is
   disabled without `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (the endpoints return `404`, the web
   hides the button; `npm run dev:oidc` in `api/` is a local stand-in to test it). Scheduled jobs (auth cleanup, recurring #12) run as npm scripts locally
   instead of Vercel Cron.
6. **Testing a feature**: unit/integration tests (`npm test`) plus a real run in the sandbox: start
   both apps, exercise the API with `curl`, and check screens with Playwright (Chromium is
   pre-installed in Claude Code cloud sessions).
7. **Done**: both apps start with one command each and `GET http://localhost:4200/api/health`
   answers through the proxy. The console mailer was checked by calling `notifier` directly; the
   first real mail is `POST /auth/email/start`, so seeing it on stdout is part of Auth (#4)'s
   check, not a separate test endpoint.

## Later: Deploy (#17)

Deferred: do this only when the owner asks. Kept here so the work is ready to pick up.

1. **GitHub**: ✅ repo pushed with `main` + `develop`. Still to do:
   - Set **`develop` as the default branch** (Settings → General), so Claude sessions and new PRs
     start from it.
   - Protect `develop` and `main` (PR + green CI required). CI already exists:
     `.github/workflows/api.yml` and `web.yml`, each running only when its folder changes.
   - Vercel: production deploys from `main`, previews from `develop` and PR branches.
2. **API on Vercel**
   - Add a Vercel entry for Express (export the app from `createApp()`; `main.ts`'s `listen` stays for
     local dev). Check that `@/` aliases resolve in the Vercel build (build with `tsc` + `tsc-alias`
     and point Vercel at `dist/`, or bundle).
   - **Logger:** file transports can't run on Vercel (read-only filesystem). Add an env flag (e.g.
     `LOG_FILE_ENABLED`, default `true`, `false` on Vercel) so prod logs go to the console, which
     Vercel collects.
   - The `docs` feature reads `src/features/docs/spec/` at runtime, so include it in the function
     bundle (`includeFiles`) or bundle the spec at build time.
   - `express-rate-limit`'s in-memory store resets per instance. Keep it as a coarse global guard;
     security-critical limits (auth) are DB-backed (see auth spec).
   - Auth env per environment: fresh `JWT_SECRET` / `OTP_PEPPER` (never the dev ones),
     `WEB_ORIGIN` = the web project's URL, `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` matching Vercel's proxy chain.
     Rate limits trust `X-Forwarded-For`, so the API must only be reachable through the web
     project's rewrite (or the hop count must strip a client-sent header); check this before
     launch.
   - Auth cleanup (rule 20): add `POST /internal/cron/auth-cleanup` behind `CRON_SECRET` calling
     the same `authService.cleanup()` as `npm run auth:cleanup`, scheduled daily.
   - Graceful shutdown hooks don't run on serverless. That's harmless, but don't rely on them there.
3. **Web on Vercel**: static Angular build + SPA fallback + **rewrite `/api/:path*` → API project**
   (see locked decision "Same origin via rewrite"). Dev: `proxy.conf.json` to `localhost:3000`.
4. **Claude Code GitHub Action** on the repo, so `@claude` in an issue or PR opens or updates a PR.
   Claude Code on the web/mobile app also works, because one session sees the whole repo.
5. **Preview deploys** per PR on both Vercel projects (both point at this repo, Root Directory
   `api` / `web`). Set each project's "Ignored Build Step" to skip builds when its folder didn't
   change (`git diff --quiet HEAD^ HEAD ./`). The web preview's `/api` points at the API's preview
   or staging URL.
6. **Mail/SMS in prod**: pick providers (see backlog) and plug them in behind `core/notification`,
   as SMTP settings or as a new adapter in `provider.registry.ts`.

## Done: Database foundation (#2)

- `drizzle-orm` + `@libsql/client` + `drizzle-kit`. `DATABASE_URL` = `file:./data/local.db` in dev,
  `libsql://…turso.io` + `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` in prod.
- `src/core/database/` exports the client. `onShutdown` closes it locally.
- Schema lives in `src/core/database/schema/<feature>.ts` (one file per feature). Migrations are
  generated by drizzle-kit and committed.
- Seed script for dev data.
- ✅ All of the above: see `api/AGENTS.md` §2 "Database" for how to add a table. No tables exist
  yet; each feature adds its own (`schema/<feature>.ts` + a generated migration).
- Still open: delete the starter's `todo` reference feature once the first real layered feature exists, and
  point `AGENTS.md` at that feature instead (see `AGENTS.md` §9).

## Locked decisions

Agreed with the user. Do not re-propose alternatives unless asked.

**Architecture**

- **One repo, two folders** (`api/`, `web/`), each deployed as its own Vercel project. This is
  simple on purpose: no monorepo tool (no Nx, no npm workspaces) and no shared package. One repo
  means one Claude Code session (from a phone) sees the specs and both apps at once.
- **API pattern = `node-express-ts-starter`**: feature folders, Clean Architecture inside a feature,
  factories with deps objects, `createResponse` envelope, domain errors. See `api/AGENTS.md`.
- **Database = SQLite**, via **Drizzle ORM** + `@libsql/client`: a local file in dev, **Turso** in prod.
- **Web = Angular**, client-side only (no SSR/SEO needed for a private app). **UI = Tailwind v4 +
  spartan/ui**, shipped as an installable **PWA** (not Ionic, not Capacitor). It behaves like a
  mobile app: bottom tab bar, bottom sheets, safe areas.
- **UI in Thai and English**, Thai by default, switched at runtime with no reload (Transloco;
  there's no SSR/SEO, so no per-language builds). Translations are bundled so both work offline.
  Formats follow the language, with the **Gregorian year in both** (ค.ศ., owner's choice in #8,
  replacing พ.ศ. in Thai). Names that read oddly
  in Thai stay English (theme names). Details: `web/AGENTS.md` → UI text, `web/DESIGN.md` §11.
- **Look: selectable themes.** Midnight Gold (navy + gold) by default, plus Indigo Night, Gold
  Coin and Plum, each with light and dark; Noto Sans Thai (loopless) self-hosted. See
  `web/DESIGN.md` §3–4.
- **Same origin via rewrite.** The web project rewrites `/api/*` to the API project, so the browser
  only ever talks to the web origin. That keeps the refresh cookie first-party. `*.vercel.app` is on
  the Public Suffix List, so two `*.vercel.app` projects are cross-site to each other, and a
  `SameSite` cookie set by the API's own domain would not be sent. No CORS is needed in prod.
- **Local-first.** Until Deploy (#17), both apps run only locally (sandbox or the owner's PC). No
  feature may require a third-party API key to run or test; anything that needs one is off when its
  env vars are missing.
- **Notifications = pluggable providers** behind `core/notification`: one `notifier`, email + SMS
  channels, provider picked by env (`EMAIL_PROVIDER`, `SMS_PROVIDER`). Email uses **Nodemailer**
  SMTP; dev prints to stdout. Real providers (prod mail, an SMS gateway) are added as adapters at
  #17 or when a feature needs them.
- **Lint baseline is shared by convention.** The web `eslint.config.mjs` mirrors the API's baseline
  rules (import order, `@/` alias, no `../` imports, unused imports, type-aware TS rules) and adds
  angular-eslint. Change a baseline rule in both repos together.

**Money & data**

- **Amounts are integers in the currency's minor unit** (satang for THB). There are no floats
  anywhere, API or DB. The API returns `{ amount, currencyCode }`, and the web formats it with `Intl`.
- **Currency is a master table** (ISO 4217 code, minor-unit digits, active flag). Only **THB** is
  active at launch; others can be switched on later. Names come from `Intl.DisplayNames` on the web,
  so they aren't stored.
- **A wallet has exactly one currency.** Its transactions inherit it. There is no FX conversion in
  the MVP, and totals across currencies are shown per currency.
- **Every user-owned row carries `userId`** (its owner), and every query is scoped by it. The one
  exception is a wallet shared through `wallet_members`: members reach that wallet and its
  transactions by their role ([offline-sync](docs/features/offline-sync.md) rules 13–16).
- **IDs are UUIDv7 strings** (time-sortable). Timestamps are stored as integer epoch ms. Calendar
  dates of transactions are stored as `YYYY-MM-DD` in the user's timezone (default `Asia/Bangkok`).

**Offline-first** (full spec: [docs/features/offline-sync.md](docs/features/offline-sync.md))

- **Works fully offline on trusted devices.** The web app reads and writes an **encrypted local
  database**; changes go to an outbox and sync with the server when online (push, then pull). The
  server is the meeting point and the authority, not the screen's data source.
- **Synced rows are sync-ready**: the device generates the UUIDv7 `id`; `updatedAt`; **soft delete**
  via `deletedAt` (tombstones); a server-assigned `changeSeq` as the pull cursor.
- **Balances and totals are always computed** from transactions, never stored.
- **Trusted device + PIN**: offline storage only when the user marks the device as trusted at
  sign-in. A 6-digit PIN unlocks it and wraps the key that encrypts the local DB. The app locks on
  open and after 5 min. 5 wrong PINs, a revoked session, or a different user signing in **wipe** the
  local data. Untrusted devices work online only.
- **Local DB = SQLite WASM in memory** + one encrypted snapshot in IndexedDB (decided by a spike
  at the start of #4a), and the app runs in one tab at a time.
- **Conflicts**: the later edit wins between the same user's devices; in a shared wallet **the
  owner always wins**; delete beats edit; the losing version is kept in `change_history` and the
  loser is told.
- **Shared wallets**: owner = full offline. Editor = view/edit/delete **online only**, but may
  **add** transactions offline. Viewer = online, read only. `wallet_members` exists from #6; the
  sharing UI is #16.

**Auth** (full spec: [docs/features/auth.md](docs/features/auth.md))

- Three ways to sign in (all built, #4): **email**, **Google**, or **phone OTP** (SMS, only for a number already
  verified on an existing account; no sign-up by phone). Email defaults to **passwordless** (one 6-digit OTP +
  magic link in the same email). A user may **optionally set a password** and then sign in with
  email + password.
- **The `users` table holds no password.** Credentials live in their own tables
  (`password_credentials`, `user_identities`).
- **Open sign-up**: anyone who can read their email can create an account. `SIGNUP_ENABLED=false`
  closes sign-up as a kill switch; a global daily email cap (`EMAIL_DAILY_LIMIT`) limits abuse.
  Family members join by **invitation** to a shared wallet (#16), matched on their verified email.
  (Replaced the earlier invite-only allowlist.)
- The rules follow current OWASP guidance (ASVS 5.0, Authentication / Password Storage / Session
  Management / OAuth 2.0 cheat sheets) and NIST SP 800-63B-4. Specifics are in the spec.
  **One deliberate exception**: the password policy is 8+ characters with all four character
  classes (owner's choice, spec rule 11), not NIST's 15+ without composition rules.

## Backlog / open questions

- **Prod email provider** for OTP and magic links (decide at #17). Dev uses Nodemailer with no
  provider. Proposal: **Resend** (free tier, offers SMTP too, so it can stay a Nodemailer config).
- **SMS gateway account**: SMS is for phone-OTP sign-in (auth spec rules 21–27), gateway =
  **ThaiBulkSMS**. Its adapter (`sms.thaibulksms.ts`) is written when the account and API key
  exist; until then dev uses the `console` SMS provider.
- **Invitations** (#16), proposal: the owner invites an email as editor/viewer. An existing user
  sees the invite in the app; anyone else gets an email whose link opens sign-in with the email
  filled in, and the invite attaches once that email is verified (matched on the verified email,
  never on the link, so a forwarded mail grants nothing). At most **one pending invite per wallet
  and email** (re-sending reuses the row, with a cooldown) and none for someone already a member,
  to keep the table small. Invites expire after **14 days** (purged by the auth cleanup job), each
  user may send **10 per day**, and invite mails count toward `EMAIL_DAILY_LIMIT`. The mail holds
  only the inviter's name and the wallet name, no free text, so it can't carry phishing.
- **GitGuardian check is red on auth PRs** (from 4.2): its GitHub App flags the made-up passwords
  in `*.test.ts` / `*.spec.ts` and the `PASSWORD_BREACH_CHECK` setting name as "Generic Password".
  They are false positives, and the check isn't required, so PRs merge anyway; don't chase it in a
  feature session. The app ignores `.gitguardian.yaml` (that file only helps a local ggshield).
  Fix once someone has dashboard access: mark the incidents as false positives and exclude test
  files in the workspace settings.
- **Open sign-up obligations**: before strangers use the app, add account deletion (with its
  data) and a short privacy notice (PDPA).
- **Shared wallet categories** (#16): when an editor adds to the owner's wallet, they pick from the
  **owner's** categories (proposal), so the owner's reports stay consistent.
- **Budget** (was #11, moved here after #10 by the owner: never used in Money Lover, and the
  Reports tab already shows spending per category against the months before). If a family
  member asks for it: per category or total per period, progress and an over-budget warning;
  the spending is `ReportService.byCategory` / `categoryTotal` (report.md → Volume), and it
  would sit in the Reports tab (the tab bar has no free slot). Needs a synced table.
- **Debt / loan (#13, next), owner's direction after #10**: borrowed money isn't income though the
  cash really goes up. The rule for the spec: **money is counted as an expense once**, either
  when it is spent (the purchase is an expense; repaying the principal isn't, only interest
  is) or when it is repaid (an instalment plan: each instalment is an expense, the purchase
  isn't recorded as one); probably a choice per debt. Today a debt can already be kept with a
  wallet and transfers (a card wallet paid by transfer, a "ให้ยืม" wallet left out of the total)
  or "ไม่รวมในรายงาน".
- **FX / multi-currency reports**: convert to THB with daily rates. Out of scope until a non-THB
  currency is actually used.
- **Import from Money Lover** (CSV export → our transactions). Decide after #8.
